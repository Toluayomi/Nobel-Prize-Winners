# Nobel-Prize-Winners

## Introduction 
The Nobel Prizes are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institutet, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals and organizations who make outstanding contributions in the fields 
of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. It was established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. In 1968, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for contributions to the field of economics. 
Each recipient, a Nobelist or laureate, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money decided annually by the Nobel Foundation. With its first edition held in 1901, the awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. In years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prizes e.g the Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War.

4. Age group that recorded the highest recipient count
5. Country as well as the University that produced the highest number of recipients 

## Data Sourcing and Transformation 
The dataset was an open sourced kaggle dataset. It was downloaded as a csv file and loaded into Power query of Power BI for effectively data cleaning and transformation. Data type was checked, conventions were renamed to ensure good data integrity foe effective analysis. 

## Data Analysis and Insight
